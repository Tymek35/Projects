# Tymoteusz Spychaj's Projects
## Angular projects
### kulki
Main project presenting my skills as frontend developer. To run project locally run `npm install`
in Angular/kulki directory and then `ng serve -o`. Functionalities involving api will not work
unless you run that locally too and provide correct apiURL in environment file. There are plans to
deploy project on server so it will be available online. When that happens the link will be
provided here.
## Python projects
### kulki_api
Main project presenting my skills as backend developer. API for angular project kulki. It was
created using Django framework and deployed using Docker. To run locally use docker like
`docker-compose up --build`.
### bachelors_thesis
Computer simulation of branching annihilating random walk used to generate data for my bachelors
thesis.
## Other projects
Projects in Java, C and C++ which were mostly assignements from IT studies in University of 
Warsaw. They include alghoritms, multithreading, data structers and object oriented programming.
